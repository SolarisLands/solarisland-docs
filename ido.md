# IDO Structure

![Solaris Land](sol1.jpg)

#### IDO time

The IDO Deposit period begins on July 10th, 2022 @ 8:00 pm UTC, runs for a few days and ends on a random day and time to prevent price manipulations.

After the Deposit period ends there will be a +24 hour Grace period. During this period you can still withdraw your USDC before the token sale finalizes.


#### Receive SOLARIS tokens

There is a hidden soft cap, if the IDO doesn't reach the soft cap all USDC will be refunded, if it reaches soft cap you will receive the SOLARIS tokens automatically back to your address based on the final price and your contribution amount after the IDO finalizes.

There is also a hidden hard cap, if the IDO reaches that the Deposit period immediately ends and the Grace period begins.


#### Withdraw USDC

You can withdraw your USDC anytime both during the Deposit and Grace periods. We won't reuse the Mango Token Sale program so you will get back your total USDC amount, we won't have partial withdrawals.

Warning: if you issue the withdrawal command you will receive back your USDC at the end of the Grace period, this is to prevent price manipulation, so participate only if you accept this!

In similar Solana IDOs whales deposited much more to push up the price and discourage small depositors, in the last minutes they withdrew large amounts, we planned our IDO to prevent this!
