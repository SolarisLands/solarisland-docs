#### As a Planet owner what can I do?

If you claimed or purchased a Planet you will be that Planet's owner, the game will use an NFT to represent the ownership right.
You will own that Planet as long as you keep that NFT in your account, you can also list it on the marketplace anytime.

As a space lord you will have land vassals (max 1000 vassals / planet), you will be able to set the **Resource TAX** and the **Sale of Land TAX (from 1% to 99%)** that you will collect from them.

**But remember, if you set the TAX too high your vassals won't build / produce as much on their lands and thus the value of your planet will also likely decrease.**



#### As a Land owner what can I do?

If you claimed or purchased a Land plot you will be that Land's owner, the game will use an NFT to represent the ownership right.
You will own that Land as long as you keep that NFT in your account, you can also list it on the marketplace anytime.

As an interstellar land farmer you can harvest your land's resources, later you can use those resources to construct new buildings for your land or increase the current production rate.



#### Number of planets

> **There will be 1000 Planets in the Solaris!**

The initial cost to claim a Planet will be 1 million Solaris, the first user who claims a Planet will own it.
That user will also receive an NFT of that Planet to prove ownership, it can be exchanged later.

*Planet claims are first come first served, already claimed Planets can't be claimed by someone else, only bought later in the market.*

**In total 1 billion Solaris must be consumed as a fee in the system to claim all available Planets.**


#### Number of lands

> **Each Planet consists of 1000 Land plots.**

There will be 1 million available Lands in the ecosystem. **(1000 Planets x 1000 Land-plot)**

However compared to Planets the initial Land price is much lower, only 1000 Solaris / Land.

**In total 1 billion Solaris must be consumed as a fee in the system to claim all available Lands.**
