# Solaris Land - Tokenomics

#### Utility functions of the token

We have been working on the Solaris Land project, an inter-galactic Metaverse game on the Solana blockchain for over a half year now. We've designed the Solaris token to be a pure utility token. Most crypto tokens have only one purpose, to participate in their governance, but with the Solaris token you will be able to do many things:

- **Claim any unclaimed Planet with it** *(initial cost will be 1 million Solaris / planet)*
- **Claim any unclaimed Land with it** *(initial cost will be 1000 Solaris / land plot)*
- **Use it as a substitute during the building process** *(initial ratio will be set to 1:1 to other resources)*
- **List your Planets/Lands in the marketplace for Solaris** *(for any price you wish)*
- **Buy Planets/Lands from other users with Solaris**


#### Supply distribution

Unfortunately in the past several good projects decided to give only a few percent of the total token supply to their community,
we decided to go against this pattern because we think this is against the ethos of a large-scale Metaverse game.

*(For example because of that Decentraland has less than 1000 concurrent active players per day.)*

We want many active players and a fairly distributed token, more players means more ingame volume and transactions, so we decided to give most of the total supply to the community.

The total supply of 3 Billion tokens is distributed as follows:

89 % of the total supply is allocated to the community.
- **70% is allocated for the IDO.**
- **16.7% goes to the Solaris DAOâ€™s treasury to be split between the marketplace liquidity, token liquidity, grants, and much more.**
- **2.3% goes to maintain the Ecosystem, to do promotions and new user acquisitions.**

11 % of the total supply is allocated to the Team and VC.
- **1% is allocated to the Team, vesting period is 1 year.**
- **10% is allocated to the Seed round, vesting period is 2 years.**

*The Seed round price was 0.003 $.*

We've raised 1 million $ (900.000 $ + 100.000 $ grant) from VCs in the Seed round.


#### IDO
We've developed our own model and decided not to follow the Mango Token sale model, also used by Solend and Aurory.
Their model is prone to manipulations because large USDC holders can deposit a large sum to discourage small holders in the Deposit period.
We designed our system to prevent this, in our model withdrawals can be requested anytime during the Deposit and Grace period but they will happen only at the end of the Grace period.
